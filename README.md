Sample scripts to parse pages from utopia-game.com.

Users can specify your URL endpoint and a key. The key is optional but I would suggest using it to ensure control on who posts.

Both raw HTML and highlighted/copy-pasted data is sent. What you use depends on how you like parsing data.

See example.php to get started.

Will later get more example scripts to parse different pages. I have quite a few scripts that I can probably share.
